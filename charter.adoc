= Platform Management Interface Task Group Charter

== Introduction
Platforms today pose challenges in terms of manageability and controllability
where the OS may have to support a variety of hardware which can be different
in design and devices connected. The extra complexity and demand to manage and
control the platform along with executing compute workloads is challenging for
Application Processors running the OS. To mitigate this, systems today contain
one or more Platform Microcontrollers which abstract various platform specific
system management and control related tasks. Such designs enable Application 
Processors to focus on the compute workloads while offloading the other tasks
like Power management, Performance management, and various platform level tasks
to Platform Microcontroller. This requires a common interface between
Application Processors and Platform Microcontrollers for communication.

== Objectives
The RPMI (RISC-V Platform Management Interface) defines a standard messaging
based interface to enable the communication between the Application processors
and the Platform Microcontrollers. The platform specific physical mechanism to
send/receive RPMI messages is referred to as RPMI Transport.
The RPMI specification also defines a reference shared memory based RPMI
transport which can be implemented by RISC-V platforms.

The RPMI TG will perform the following tasks:

* Define a non-isa RPMI specification which defines extensible and modular
messaging protocol between the Application Processors and the Platform
Microcontrollers.
* Define a SBI extension to allow multiple supervisor domains
to share the same physical RPMI transport through the SBI implementation.
* Deliver the proof-of-concept implementation of RPMI specification and SBI extension.
* Coordination with other TGs to keep other RISC-V specifications
(such as SBI specification) in sync.
